# C CLI Clock

This is a small project rebuilt from
[here](https://github.com/sharmavins23/rust-cli-clock) which creates a rendered
updating clock in the CLI through C. It's a small project to compare and
contrast implementations between languages.

In particular, a lot of the code formatting and style is changed to its relative
C counterpart (while _attempting_ to follow good practice.) Functionality is
also broken out into separate files and functions in an attempt to simplify
structure.

This project also has the special advantage of being a demonstration of the
basic make and compile structure for simple C-based projects. Generally, it will
be useful as a reference.

## Running

Simply type in the command line:

```bash
make
clear
build/main
```

This will build and execute the program.

## Pairing

This is meant to be a pair project across multiple different programming
languages just to examine the significant differences between handling of
higher-level code. The following is a (growing) list of languages I've
reimplemented this project in:

-   [Rust](https://github.com/sharmavins23/rust-cli-clock)
-   [C](https://github.com/sharmavins23/c-cli-clock)
